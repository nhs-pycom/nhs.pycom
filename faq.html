<span class="nhsuk-details__summary-text"></span>
    What is open source?
  </span>
</summary>
<div class="nhsuk-details__text">
  <p>Open source software like Python, is software which is released under a permissive licence which allows for anyone to freely access, use, modify, and share the source code of the software for any purpose. In practice, this means it is freely available to those in the NHS and beyond, without cost, and has a large user base. While Python itself is open source, you can choose whether (and are strongly encouraged) to release your own code as open source, in line with government policy such as Data Saves Lives, the NHS Service Standard and the Goldacre review.
